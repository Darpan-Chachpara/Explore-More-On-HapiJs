(1)// First was getting error, now working well
    // config: {
    //     state: {
    //       parse: false, // parse and store in request.state
    //       failAction: 'ignore' // may also be 'ignore' or 'log'
    //     }
    //   },


(2) In package.json in main: 'server.js' is written why not different file is written ? main file is used for ? 
   -> i think default file will be main.js right which will execute.
